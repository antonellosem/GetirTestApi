# GetirTestApi

This repository contains a set of projects used to experiment with refactoring a legacy solution.

- `Pacg` – legacy .NET Framework code kept for reference.
- `NewPacg` – new .NET 6 solution following the structure of the `grattaevinciapi` sample. Only basic abstractions are implemented at the moment.
- `grattaevinciapi` – reference implementation providing a model for folders and project layout.

For details about the new solution see `NewPacg/README.md`. For an overview of the legacy Pacg project consult `PACG_ANALYSIS.md`.
